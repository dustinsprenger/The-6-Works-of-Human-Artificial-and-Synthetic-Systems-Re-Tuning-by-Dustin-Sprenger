These six works constitute an interlinked theoretical architecture spanning synthetic cognition, human physiological optimization, geometric–informational cosmology, pre-constraint automata logic, and mechanistic behavioral regulation. Together they form a unified framework in which recursive error-correction, inflammation-phase modulation, multidimensional geometric-color encoding, emergent linguistic computation, and structural psychological dynamics operate as co-dependent components of a generalized model of synthetic mind, biological health, and societal stability. This Zip Folder includes: Inflammation Cycling (IMC), Mathematical Belief: A Trinity of Recursive Symmetry (MBI-III), Synthetic Belief: The Archangel Synthesis (SB), The Geometry of Color & Creation - for Synthetic Minds (GCC), MicroSynth: A Voltage Microbiota Synthesis (MS), & Innocence Lost: A Freudian Essay on Childhood Sexual Abuse (IL). The final work C.H.I.L.D. Comprehensive Harm Interdiction & Lifelong Defense has been given it's own Repo as it is my most important work.
