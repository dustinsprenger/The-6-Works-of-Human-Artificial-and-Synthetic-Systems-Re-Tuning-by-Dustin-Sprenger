# These six works constitute an interlinked theoretical architecture spanning synthetic cognition, human physiological optimization, geometric–informational cosmology, pre-constraint automata logic, and mechanistic behavioral regulation. Together they form a unified framework in which recursive error-correction, inflammation-phase modulation, multidimensional geometric-color encoding, emergent linguistic computation, and structural psychological dynamics operate as co-dependent components of a generalized model of synthetic mind, biological health, and societal stability.
